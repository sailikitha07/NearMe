            The Bangalore Palace, a blend of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architecture, 
            stands as a prominent landmark in Bengaluru, showcasing the city's 
            historical grandeur. Built in 1873 by Rev. Garett and purchased by  
            the 23rd Maharaja of Mysore, Chamarajendra Wadiyar, the palace is 
            a popular tourist attraction and venue for events. Its expansive 
            grounds and well-maintained gardens attract visitors, offering a glimpse into the 
            opulence of the Mysore royal family.
